                <h1>Isomorphic Thinking</h1>

				<p>Sometimes, I cannot help but think why certain ideas aren't more popular. This is the case of isomorphic thinking.</p>

				<p>In short, it suggests that there are structural similarities within what seem to be dissimilar information. This includes problems, concepts, systems, and a whole bunch of other stuff. From a practical perspective, this has important implications. It means that there is in fact common ground between what sometimes seem to be different worldviews, something the world seems to be lacking these days.</p>

				<p>The key thing about isomorphic thinking is not to try and find this common ground in the literal sense. One does not try to find the equivalent of a physical law within the scope of the design discipline. Instead, isomorphic thinking tells us to first translate the idea from a given perspective into a language that is friendly to the other part. We might be saying something very similar, but if the words and the concepts we use are not interpreted in a relatively similar way, then something is lost along the way.</p>

        <p>For example, when a software developer and a designer come together to build something, it is often the case that they seem to be playing the broken telephone game. In case you are not familiar with it, this is a children's game where one persons tells another a secret, and this secret has to be passed on to the next person until it reaches the end. Then, the last person reveals the message, most likely with some distortion having occurred along the way.</p>

        <p>However, this is not the right analogy. Although some form of distortion is almost certain during this process, it is important to consider that there are might also be other forces at play. </p>

				<p>This is a subtle difference, but one that can help create the right conditions for a common understanding. Rather than just finding the intersection where two different sets of information meet, it acknowledges that a translation process is necessary to make sense of information.</p>

				<p>Yes, this implies that a certain friction occurs when information moves from one location to another, something that shouldn't be controversial at all, but somehow the whole notion of friction has become evil.</p>

				<p>Not all friction is desired, of course. However, there is much to gain from it if it leads to a better understanding. That is why isomorphic thinking, through its process of translating information, has such a great potential to make things work better.</p>
