                <h1>What Is Content Strategy?</h1>
                <h3><i>Your team may have great developers and designers, but without the skills of a content strategist you might be throwing away your money.</i></h3>
                <p>I've seen this way too many times. Organizations spend a lot of money trying to build world class digital products only to deliver something that falls below their expectations. No matter how hard they try, they cannot seem to deliver something that achieves the right level of quality. The reason, surprisingly, is not poor code. It is also not a matter of the design being 'ugly', although the problem is indeed one of design. The reason why it fails is probably its content.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The content of your product may be its silent killer. Paradoxically, it is hard to pinpoint exactly what content is. It has become one of those words that means many things to different people, and there isn't a widespread interpretation as to what it encompasses. Having worked with content for over a decade, I have come to think of it as anything that is published for others to see or interact with. It is not only what is published in a blog or social media. Ultimately, content includes anything that is published on the web, on an app, or other digital product, as well as on the phyisical world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Most companies approach content as if it were a matter of interfaces or how things look. In other cases, it is just part of an SEO strategy or a way to get some likes. Although all of this matters a lot, it only reprensents one aspect of that which users come into contact with. Great content helps users navigate from point A to B. It also helps them make sense of information. Great content is about satisfying users' needs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It comes as no surprise then that it makes sense to talk about having a content strategy. Not doing so can be a costly mistake that silently destroys your efforts. A solid content strategy is one that considers user needs as well as business ones and the technical aspects of your organization.</p>
