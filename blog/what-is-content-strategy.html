                <h1>What Is Content Strategy?</h1>
                <h3><i>Your team may have great developers and designers, but without a content strategy you might be throwing away your money.</i></h3>
                <p>I've seen this way too many times. Organizations spend a lot of money trying to build world class digital products only to deliver something that falls below their expectations. No matter how hard they try, they cannot seem to deliver something that achieves the right level of quality. The reason, surprisingly, is not poor code. It is also not a matter of the design being 'ugly.' The reason why it fails is probably its content, or rather its lack of a strategy around it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The content of your product may be its silent killer. It is hard to pinpoint exactly what content is. It has become one of those words that means many things to different people, and there isn't a widespread interpretation as to what it encompasses. Having worked with content for over a decade, I have come to think of it as anything that is published for others to see or interact with. It is not only what is published in a blog or social media. Ultimately, content includes anything that is published on the web, on an app, or other digital product, as well as on the phyisical world. It is also that which goes unpublished.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Most companies approach content as if it were just a matter of interfaces or how things look. In other cases, it ends up becoming part of an SEO strategy or a way to get some likes. Although all of this matters a lot, it does not represent what content actually is. Great content helps users navigate from point A to B. It helps them make sense of information.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A content strategy can be seen as a consistent way to make this happen. As other forms of strategy, it is a matter of choices. You cannot do everything, and you also shouldn't want to. It is important to narrow down your efforts and focus on a few specific but clear things. A solid content strategy is one that considers user needs as well as business ones and the technical aspects of your organization.</p>
