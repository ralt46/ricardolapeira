                <h1>What Is a Content Strategy?</h1>

				<p>I've seen this many times. Organizations spend a significant amount of money trying to build world-class digital products only to deliver something that falls short of their expectations. No matter how hard they try, they cannot seem to deliver something that achieves the right level of quality.</p> 
				
				<p>The reason, surprisingly, is not poor code. It is also not a matter of the design being 'ugly.' The main reason I find many digital products fail is their content, or rather, the lack of a content strategy.</p>
				
				<h2><i>What Is Content?</i></h2>
				<p>The poor content of your product may be its silent killer. It is hard to pinpoint exactly what content is. It has become one of those words that means many things to different people, and there isn't a widespread interpretation as to what it encompasses.</p> 
				
				<p>Having worked with content for over a decade, I have come to think of it as anything that is published for others to see or interact with, whether digitally or physically. It is not only what appears on a blog or social media. It can also include what you see on a website, an app, or even a report.</p>
				
				<p>Most teams working with content approach it as if it were just a matter of how things look or sound. It is common to find that content is sometimes confused with content creation, so it ends up becoming part of an SEO strategy or a means to get some likes. This is a very superficial approach to content. Although all of this matters a great deal, it does not accurately represent what content actually is and the powerful impact it can have. In practice, great content has the power to help users navigate from point A to B while helping guarantee a powerful user experience. It can also help give your brand a concrete identity.</p>
				
				<p>Ultimately, content is not only about your message or how it portrays your brand in the minds of others. It is also about helping users make sense of information, a quality that has become more important than ever in our attention-scarce world. It can have very concrete consequences for your organization, like helping improve sales, improve your brand image, or reach a broader audience. In some cases, it might even become the differentiating factor that allows you to outperform competitors.</p>
				
				<p>Delivering great content is not a luxury that only big companies can afford. Everyone, from a small to a medium-sized company, should care about its content. For your content to succeed, you need a clear and well-structured content strategy.</p>
				
				<h2><i>Definition of a Content Strategy</i></h2>
				<p>A good content strategy for digital products helps guide your decisions. Its goal should be to help you craft the structure of everything you do when it comes to your content. This encompasses everything from information architecture to the user experience and UX writing. Rather than focusing on short-sighted actions or unfounded assumptions, a content strategy allows you and your team to focus on actions that can have a huge impact on your business.</p>
				
				<p>As with other forms of strategy, a content strategy is a matter of choices. You cannot and shouldnâ€™t do everything. It is important to narrow down your efforts and focus on a few specific but clear things. This involves a lot of research, just as it requires some trial and error. Although mistakes will surely be made, the ability to change direction and find out what works becomes essential.</p>
				
				<p>A good content strategy is one that considers user needs as well as business goals and the technical aspects of your organization. It focuses on understanding your audience while defining clear objectives and helping you lay out sustainable processes. This is very helpful if you truly want to create strong and lasting connections with your users, and most importantly, if you want to create successful digital products.</p>
