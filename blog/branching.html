                <h1>Branching</h1>

                <p>“Branching means you diverge from the main line of development
                 and continue to do work without messing with that main line.”</p>

                <p><i>- About git branching from the book ‘Pro Git’</i></p>

                <p>Sometimes I wish certain things in life resembled developing software. In particular, I like the whole idea of how Git works: to be able to diverge from one’s current path, without having to discard it, and be able to come back to edit it. One can only dream of something like that.</p>

                <p>However, as scary as it might sound, it is also exciting to know that every decision we take in our lives away from the screen has consequences, and that taking a certain path closes another. Otherwise, we would be easily overwhelmed by the number of forks and paths.</p>

                <p>Allowing ourselves to explore new paths can seem scary at first, but it is also what makes life interesting. It grants us the responsibility of choosing.</p>
