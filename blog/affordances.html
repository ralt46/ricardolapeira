				<p>Most decision-makers inside companies suffer from a severe case of wishful thinking. They want to achieve specific outcomes without actually building the paths that help users achieve desired outcomes. It is like wanting users to go from point A to point B without actually paving the road.</p>

				<p>Most of the time, the process surrounding the outcome reflects the logic of ‘because I have A, then B will happen’ without actually even thinking if such a thing can occur. A better way to think about this would be to change the thought process to ‘because I have made it possible to go from A to B, people will now be able to make their journey.’ Although it seems like just wordplay, the difference in these two thought processes can make a huge difference. Building the road isn’t enough by itself to achieve a desired outcome, but it is an important step in the process.</p>

				<p>A common case occurs when working with content. Companies think, for example, that if they have a blog, then readers are going to automatically read it. It might be the case that some people will. But to most readers, the mere fact that the blog exists isn’t enough. The paths to reach the blog need to be made clear in order for readers to get there. This means not only promoting it, but also making it visible, writing relevant articles, and making it look interesting, among other things.</p>

				<p>The same happens with newsletters. Many companies expect that, just because they have a newsletter, readers will automatically open their emails and become clients. The paths that take a reader from the newsletter to becoming a client need to be clearly laid out. They shouldn’t just be left to the imagination of the reader to figure them out.</p>

				<p>It is useful to leave aside this form of wishful thinking by focusing on affordances. This is a great concept borrowed from the field of design that establishes what a user can or cannot do based on the properties of the object with which they interact. Some affordances are clearer than others, making a hierarchy of affordances one of the best tools for you to guide users across preferred paths.</p>

				<p>If you want your audience to go from point A to point B, make sure to draw clear paths for them and give them options. Only after you build the bridge can you think about helping them cross it.</p>
