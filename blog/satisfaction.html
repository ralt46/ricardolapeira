                <h1>Satisfaction</h1>

				<p>I’m not the first person to point out the brilliance of The Rolling Stones’ song (I can’t get no) satisfaction.  For anyone trying to reach an audience, the song is a great reminder of how the desire to change, to try out something new because things can be different, is an important driver of human behaviour.</p>

				<p>What is sometimes not that obvious is that not everyone is dissatisfied. Some people are satisfied with how things are. They are the ones who do not want change. They would prefer for things to stay the same.</p>

				<p>Whatever idea you’re trying to work out, remember this distinction. Some people want change, while others don’t. Keep this in mind when thinking about who you will be interacting with.</p>
