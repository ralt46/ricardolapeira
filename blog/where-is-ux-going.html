                <h1>Where Is UX Going?</h1>

				<p>As someone who is not a designer, I know firsthand how different roles can bring meaningful contributions to the table when discussing the UX of digital products. This, surprisingly, is not something that many people easily accept or even understand. To them, it is an implicit fact that the UX of a digital product belongs exclusively to designers. However, things have been changing due to a number of factors and this narrative is finally shifting.</p>
				
				<p>Here are some trends I’ve been seeing for a while that make me think that UX is moving towards a more diverse talent pool:</p>

				<h2>Solving Complex Problems</h2>

				<p>The problems digital products want to tackle are getting more and more complex. Doing so will require all sorts of expertise, not just from people in the design field.</p> 
				
				<p>This has two important implications. First, designers will have to get comfortable learning about things beyond design. Second, people in non-design roles will have to learn about design processes.</p>

				<h2>The Rise of AI</h2>

				<p>It is hard to talk about AI without either sounding like a fan or being too critical. Some praise the technology blindly while others seem to despise every aspect of it. When it comes down to practical matters, I believe the truth lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
				
				<p>AI is not as powerful or useless as some might want it to be. It is undeniable that it is changing how things are done, for good or bad. Personally, I find it to be a powerful tool that can help improve processes, save time, and, why not, sometimes even find ways to be creative. Although this is bound to reach a wall at some point, there seems to be more coming in this direction.</p>

				<h2>The Productivity Trap</h2>

				<p>With the rise of AI, most companies will likely push their teams to increase their productivity. Although they will want to do more with less, they might end up finding the hard way that this doesn’t necessarily create better digital products.</p>
				
				<p>Teams that learn to control their tools instead of them being controlled by their tools will have a significant advantage. More will not always be better.</p>

				<h2>The Business Side of Things</h2>

				<p>From a business perspective, UX has always faced challenges. Many managers despise not being able to directly quantify its impact. Unfortunately, it seems this will not change any time soon.</p>
				
				<p>With that said, the real risk is that, combined with the general adoption of AI, design will end up becoming even more homogenous than it already is to make it quantifiable. The silver lining is that this becomes an opportunity for teams that are able to find their own unique voice without sacrificing the business aspect of design.</p>

				<h2>Ethics Will Matter More than Ever</h2>

				<p>For anyone who is truly committed to making great digital products with users in mind, this will probably come as no surprise. The sad part is that, although ethics will definitely matter more than ever, in reality most companies will probably keep on doing business as usual.</p>

				<h2>Strategy Will Be at the Center</h2>

				<p>Design will move further away from being something “artsy.” This is not to say that design is becoming an absolute commodity, although it is in some ways. The point is that design will be forced to mature by becoming more strategic, that is, to make specific choices on what is expected from it.</p>

				<h2>A More Mature Role for Design</h2>

				<p>Lastly, and even though I’ve been saying that UX will need more people from different fields, I feel I should clarify that there are no reasons to believe that design’s role will be diminished. On the contrary, it will probably get stronger.</p>
				
				<p>As more people with different roles become part of UX processes, people with design skills will become even more crucial, whether they are designers or not. </p>
