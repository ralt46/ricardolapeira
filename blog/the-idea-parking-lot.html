                <h1>The Idea Parking Lot</h1>

                <p>Sometimes an idea sounds very good, but when you try to integrate it into your current project, there doesn’t seem to be a way to make it work. If this is the case, don’t just throw it away.</p>

                <p>Instead, create an idea parking lot. You can always come back to it and see if there’s anything worth using.</p>

                <p>As its name suggests, an idea parking lot is literally that, a place to put your ideas while you go on doing something else. Some ideas will never become more than that. Others may evolve into something more elaborate. In some cases, an idea may even become part of another project. The point is to have a repertoire that you can always go back to.</p>

                <p>Creating an idea parking lot does not require fancy tools or a lot of time. You can use something as simple as a note-taking app or a spreadsheet. I personally like to use whiteboards because they allow me to use visual references in a way that helps keep context without having to later figure out what I wanted to say.</p>
