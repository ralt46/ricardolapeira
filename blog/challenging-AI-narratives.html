                <h1>Challenging Dominant AI Narratives</h1>

        				<p>One of the greatest things about our day and age is the plurality of opinions and perspectives that we get to come into contact with. However, the downside of it is that we get to come into contact with, sometimes, too many opinions and perspectives.</p>

        				<p>These are not all produced in the same way. Some of them get amplified while others simply fade away into oblivion. This by itself is not bad. The problem is when the dominant narrative becomes dominant because of asymmetries in power. This is what’s happening with the narrative around AI.</p>

        				<p>A small group of powerful companies with vast resources behind them has made many of us believe that there is no alternative to the AI tools they are suggesting. The truth is that this narrative only acknowledges a biased and self-benefiting perspective.</p>

                <p>In reality, tools like AI do not have to be one way or another, and although this makes developing digital tools challenging, it also gives users tremendous power. I know it is hard when we are on the receiving end, but as users, we deserve better tools and not the ones that a few would like us to use.</p>

                <p>How can one challenge their narrative? Unfortunately, I am still trying to figure things out myself.</p>
