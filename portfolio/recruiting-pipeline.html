        <h1>Recruiting Talent with Content</h1>
        <h3>Project: Creating content for a recruiting pipeline</h3>
        <p><i>Note: due to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), I cannot share many details about this project. If you would like to learn more, please get in touch directly with me.</i></p>
        <p>It is hard for any company to grow if it cannot hire the right talent. Luckily, content can attract ideal candidates.</p>
        <p>My client, an international services outsourcing agency, found out that using a strategic content approach can have a powerful impact on the recruiting process.</p>

        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>My client for this project belonged to a highly competitive service industry where having skilled talent can make a big difference. Its HR team needed to make sure that their recruiting efforts were paying off. They needed to clearly communicate that the company was a more attractive employer than the competition.</p>
        <p>They initially contacted me to work on an ad campaign to attract more applicants. However, after numerous difficulties to come up with a campaign, I noticed that there was a deeper problem: the company wasn't really communicating effectively. They did not seem to have a clear strategy to address their audience.</p>
        <p>Aware of the unease this conversation would bring, I raised the issue. After analysing my aguments, the HR team ended up questioning their initial approach. They realised that they weren't really that different from the competition. In fact, they were very generic in terms of how they were communicating. This detonated an identity crisis.</p>

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>For some time now, the company thought of itself as a unique place to work. Realising this wasn't the case was a harsh truth, but one the HR team took gracefully.</p>
        <p>They were aware that they not only had to bring in candidates, interview them, and hire them. They also needed to build a great hiring experience as this was the company's first impression for many candidates.</p> 
        <p>For a long time their recruiting process had been working fine, but as they faced an aggressive international expansion they started to realise that the number of applications were not coming in as expected. Also, many candidates were abandoning their processes with no apparent reason.</p>
        <p>Something was going on that was affecting the recruiting pipeline, and they needed to solve it fast if they wanted to sustain the company's growth.</p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>The first step was to understand the psychographics of candidates. The team hadn't really given much thought to questions like who these people were, what they valued, or what they were looking for in a job.</p>
        <p>Because finding candidates to interview for our research wasn't an option due to privacy concerns, we decided to interview recent hires. Being new to the company, they still had some of that candidate mentality in them. This approach proved to be crucial for our goal.</p>
        <p>We realised that many of the premises that the recruiting team had were incorrect. They had assumed incorrectly that candidates were looking for something that was far away from reality. This explained in part why their recruiting efforts weren't paying off.</p>
        <p>We ended up creating a content strategy to attract the right talent. Having new insights, we worked out a message that reflected the company's strengths and at the same time aligned to the expectations of candidates. The result was a successful campaign, and most importantly, a new way to look at the problem they had been experiencing.</p>
        <p>Initially, my client only wanted to work on an ad campaign. This changed as the HR team realized they needed to improve the recruiting pipeline. A revamped recruiting newsletter, targeted content for social media channels, an internal referrals campaign, and a series of webinars were just some of the products we came up with.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we identified and solved specific pain points in the recruiting process. We designed a series of emails to keep candidates posted on the status of their processes. In the new process candidates felt valued, and this ended up reducing the churn rate while at the same time strengthening the brand. Some people told recruiters that, even though they weren't selected, they felt so respected throughout the process that they were willing to apply again in the future.</p>

        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <p>A structured content strategy can turn a generic recruiting pipeline into a powerful engine for growth. As my client found out, our joint efforts helped boost candidate applications and improve their quality. It also helped improve the candidates' journey by eliminating pain points, increasing the chances that they completed their process.</p>
        <p>You too can attract great talent instead of wasting efforts on unqualified candidates.</p>
