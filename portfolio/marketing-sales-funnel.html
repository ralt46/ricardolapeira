        <h1>Marketing Sales Funnel</h1>
        <h3>Project: Improving an existing sales pipeline</h3>
        <p><i>Note: due to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), I cannot share many details about this project. If you would like to learn more, please get in touch directly with me.</i></p>
        <p>Sales are a fundamental part of any business. To different companies a sale might mean different things, but at the end of the day, everyone needs to sell.</p>
        <p>Implementing a marketing sales funnel can improve sales. Equally important, it can help you build your brand. By addressing the needs of potential clients, a funnel can help convert them from a simple lead to a true believer in what you do. That is what I successfully helped achieve in this ambitious but very impactful project that moved the needle for an international services outsourcing agency.</p>

        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>When it comes to sales, there is strength in numbers. The more interested people you have in your product or service, the more you can potentially sell. However, you need to make it happen.</p>
        <p>A great way to do so is through a marketing sales funnel. This can help improve sales and additionally strengthen your brand. It keeps track of important information that helps achieve goals.</p>
        <p>The agency understood this, so they set out an ambitious plan to implement a marketing sales funnel. This would help drive leads that the sales team could convert into actual clients. They also wanted to strengthen ties with existing clients. To do so, they needed someone to help out with everything content related.</p>

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>These days everyone is competing for attention. The least you can do when someone decides to interact with your brand is give them content that actually delivers value. Don't waste their time with useless information or long articles that serve your SEO goals but don't really connect with your audience.</p>
        <p>The company was well aware of the path it needed to take, the problem was that they had a limited budget. This meant they had a small team, of which I was part of.</p>
        <p>The good things was that, being aware of their limitations, they were willing to carry it out in different stages to allow them to make incremental improvements.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>The company directives wanted to strengthen their online presence through an ambitious plan. They wanted to improve the domain authority of their website, implement an SEO blog strategy, launch ambitious ad campaigns, and improve the copywriting for their different services, among other things.</p>
        <p>Because of the scope of the project, I had to learn many things along the way. This wasn't an issue for the agency. On the contrary, it was an asset. They needed someone who knew the fundamentals of how to translate great content into an even greater User Experience but was also willing to learn on the go. Although challenging, I found this to be very rewarding.</p>
        <p>We decided work priorities based on what we considered most impactful and easy to implement. The result was a smooth project pipeline where everyone was informed of the tasks we were working on.</p>
        <p>In terms of results, the company was able to considerably increase its sales. Also, it managed to strengthen its brand for the segment of existing clients. Thanks to a highly integrated effort, the User Experience for the agency's different channels was significantly improved. These meant a boost of their bottom-line.</p>

        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <p>It was rewarding to see the impact of what we had built. However, I also started to notice that most efforts were slowly shifting towards SEO. This is a common thing to happen because the easiness with which it can be measured. It is more tangible than, say, taking care of the brand.</p>
        <p>A marketing sales funnel is very powerful, and it is at its best when it is able to focus on sales as well as your brand. By finding the balance that works for you, I can help you make the most out of your efforts and attain your goals.</p>
