      <h2>Solutions that work for you</h2>
      <p>Most projects can benefit from a project-based approach instead of the traditional hourly rate.</p> 
      <p>In practical terms, this means you don't have to worry about my work hours. You will always receive my highest commitment to your project while taking care of your budget.</p>
      <p>Prices may vary depending on the scope and complexity of the project as well as the value it delivers. For more information, contact me and let's discuss in detail what your needs are.</p>
