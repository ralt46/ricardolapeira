                <p>When it comes to content, there is a lot that teams need to deal with. Usually, it is more than they can handle.</p>
                <p>You can think of me as someone who adds skills and bandwidth to your organization. Also, think of me as that person who likes to ask tough questions that will put your strategy to the test. As someone with a background in philosophy, I do not follow a traditional consultancy approach. As an engineer, I am rigorous at what I do.</p>

                            <p>Content is basically any digital material that can be consumed. It helps shape the User Experience, position your brand, and communicate clearly. It is everywhere, not just on social media or blogs. You can also find it in the newsletters you receive, the websites you visit, or the apps you use.</p>
                            <p>As a Content Strategist, I will work together with your team to make the most of your content so that you achieve your goals. Together, we will create relevant connections with your audience, build better digital products, and simplify content creation processes.</p>

                            <p>In practice, I will work together with you and your team to identify what 'great content' means for your brand. In some cases this will require producing content for you or assisting you in its elaboration. In other cases it will demand performing research. Whatever the case is, I am here to help.</p>
                            <p>Most content strategists use design methods. I am no exception, although I also like to use philosophical tools to ask the right questions. Through practical methods like structured inquiry and creative sessions, we will get to the core of what truly matters for your brand and its content.</p>
