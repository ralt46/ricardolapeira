                <p>I can proudly say I've collaborated on multiple <a href="" class="no_class">award-winning projects</a>. My secret power is bringing people together to find that special something that is hiding in plain sight and then making incredible stuff happen.</p>
                <p>You can think of me as someone who adds skills and bandwidth to your organization. Also, think of me as that person who likes to ask uncomfortable questions that will make you reevaluate your strategy. As a philosopher, I do not follow a traditional consultancy approach. As an engineer, I am rigorous at what I do.</p>

                            <p>Content is everywhere, not just on social media or blogs. It does not matter if it is the newsletters you receive, the websites you visit, or the apps you use, content is always present. <i>It is basically any digital material that can be consumed</i>, and it helps shape our User Experience.</p>
                            <p>As a Content Strategist, I will make the most of your content so that you achieve your goals. Together, we can answer questions like who's your audience, what they care about, how they communicate, and how to connect with them.</p>
                            <p>In short, I can help your business navigate the digital noise to increase your content capital and create more meaningful connections. This, of course, translates into a positive impact for your business.</p>

                            <p>In practice, I will work together with you and your team to identify what 'great content' means for your brand. In some cases I will even produce content for you or assist you in its elaboration. Occasionally, I will even help you refine your brand.</p>
                            <p>Most content strategists use design methods. I prefer to use philosophy in order to ask the right questions. Through practical philosophical methods like structured inquiry and creative sessions, we will get to the core of what truly matters for your content.</p>
                            <p>Using world-class tools and best practices, I will help your team connect better with your audiences, users, or even within your organization. Rather than giving you a success formula, I will embark you on a never-ending journey towards success.</p>
