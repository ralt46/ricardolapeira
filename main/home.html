      <h2>Content, Communications and Creative Strategist</h2>
      <p>Not all companies need a full-time Content Strategist.</p>
      <p>Sometimes it's best to bring in someone for a specific project. With +10 years of international experience working at the intersection of marketing, brand strategy, and digital product development, I can help your team be more creative, achieve operational excellence, and attain goals. Here's a list of my <a href="services.html" class="no_class">digital content services</a>.</p>
      <p>Being intellectually curious is part of who I am. It makes my work unique, relevant, and valuable. These days I'm mostly into the philosophy of technology and futures thinking (strategic foresight). You can read my thoughts about these and other topics on my <a href="blog.html" class="no_class">blog</a>.
      <p>You can also look at my work <a href="portfolio.html" class="no_class">portfolio</a>.</p>
